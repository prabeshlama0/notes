AWS (global cloud computing/ms/agile) 
Amazon Web Service
Cloud computing: storing and accessing the data through the internet.
It does not store data on the hard disk of your personal computer. You access the data through the remote server.
AWS: it offers the wide range of different business purpose global cloud-based products. The products includes storage, database, analytics, networking, mobile, development tools, enterprise applications, with a pay-as-you-go pricing model.
 AWS: from Amazon offers the deployment services;
 Pay--> virtual service only while it runs.
 

1. Compute
2. Migration
3. Security
4. Storage (s3)--> Simple Storage Service
5. Networking
6. Messaging
7. Database
8. Management Tool
9. Analytics

Why AWS:
Allows the organizations to use the already familiar programming models, os, database, and architecture
Quickly and securely host your application
Cost effective--> pay only what you use
Offers fast deployment
Can add and remove the capacity
Allowed cloud access quickly with limitless capacity
Total cost of the ownership is very low compared to any private/dedicated servers
Offers centralized billing And management
Allows to deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks

Benefits:
GO Global in minutes

Architecture: 19 geographical regions. 50 Availability Zones

Product & Services
Compute Services;
EC2, Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing

VPC(Virtual private Cloud)
Storage Service: Amazone EBS, S3, Glacier, 
Database Services: RDS
Deployment and Administration: CloudWatch IAM, CloudFormation
Application Service: 


VPC?

VPC
10.0.0.0/26
IPv= 4Blocks
1 Byte =8 bits
How many IP address: 32-26=6
2^6=64


Public subnet: the resources are directly accessible through the internet by the end users
Private Subnet: the resources are not not connected with the internet
Public-1a Subnet-10.0.0.0/28
How many IP address: 2^(32-28)=2^4=16
Public-1b Subnet- 10.0.0.16/28

Private-1a Subnet= 10.0.0.32/28
Private-1b Subnet= 10.0.0.48/28

Subnet Routing:
Route Table: 

Inbound traffic: traffic coming from the users to the website(web application or web server)
Outbound Traffic: response coming back to the end users from the websites


Target: 
To make the Subnet a public Subnet, we need to add the route from everywhere to the "internet gateway"
As target. So that the public subnet resources can be accessible from outside/ internet



EC2

How to make instance:
Choose AMI
Choose instance Type
Configure instance:
   * choose Network(VPS) and subnet
   * Auto-assign Public IP --> enabled
Add Storage:(Amazon EBS volume) 30 gb is free for tire offer
   Different types of the volume
   We create the instance in the particular region in the specific availability zone
   

Add tags
Configure Security Group:
  Type: RDP(window) port range: 3389 Source: there are three


Key pairs:
Public and private

Decrypted Password: iaV)oQ?WKp6IJu=UsC(Ph;pa$qKusOE* 
IP address: 54.193.53.37
Administrator



Creating the window os instance in Public Subnet:
We we make the instance in the public subnet there is the direct connection with the internet

Creating EC2 instance in the private subnet:
Public IP	54.153.108.143
User name	Administrator
Password	         MZTJtW83KF2h2puBtnG66N5nuT@VRoaW

Private Desktop can not connect to the remote computer because of the internet because of the EC2 instance is created in the Private subnet

We couldn't connect to the remote PC. Make sure the PC is turned on and connected to the network, and that remote access is enabled.

We we need to go to the instance created on the public subnet and then access the EC2 instance from that.

1. Lunching EC2 instance in window Os in public subnet
    We are able to access that instance directly from the internet
2. Lunching EC2 instance in window os in private subnet
    We are not able to access that instance directly form the internet. For that we need to log in the public instance and using the private ips of private instance we can log in the private instance.
   And there is no internet connectivity in the private instance.
  

 How to get internet connectivity in the private instance:
  If we are not adding route to Internet gateway in any route table, so every subnet associated with, can be seen as a private Subnet. But to have an internet connectivity for the resource inside private subnet, we add a route target to NAT instance

We need to create the NETGET Way in the public subnet and we need to add route in the private route table.

NAT getaway acts like the bridge between the internet gateway and the public subnet

Mysql commands and their actions;

Mysql is not case sensitive.
To connect with mysql server: mysql -u root -p


The SQL Keywords are case-insensitive (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc), but are often written in all caps. However in some setups table and column names are case-sensitive. MySQL has a configuration option to enable/disable it. Usually case-sensitive table and column names are the default on Linux MySQL and case-insensitive used to be the default on Windows, but now the installer asked about this during setup. For MSSQL it is a function of the database's collation setting.

1. show databases; 
-> will show all the databases in the system.

2. create database database_Name; 
 -> will create the database.

3. drop database database_name;
 -> will delete the database

4. To create a table under any database we have to give following command first:
  
-> use database_Name;
Then only we can create the tables under that database.
-> create table table_Name(column_Name1 datatype, column_Name2 datatype, .....);

5. desc table_name;
 -> will display the fields and datatypes of the tables.
6. To insert the values in the table column:

-> insert into table_name values('column1 content', 'column2 content',....);

7. SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME; // will display all fields available in the database.

8. To add and delete




 the columns in the table;
 -> alter table table_name
 -> add column_Name datatype; // to add the column
 -> drop column_Name; // will delete the column
9. -> DROP TABLE table_name; // will delete the table from the database.

10. To update the row:
     update table_name 
    -> set columnName='value wanted to update'
    -> where columnName ='reference value';

11. If you want to delete the row from the table:
 -> delete from table_name where column_name='';
12. Delete from table_Name
  -> will delete all the data from the table
13. To delete table from the table
  -> drop table table_Name


14. If you have created a table already but forget to add a column in the table you can use the following commands:

-> alter table table_name
   Add column coulumnName columntype() after existedColumnName;
15. If you want to delete a column then use the following commands:
-> alter table table_name
   Drop column columnName

SET GLOBAL time_zone = '+3:00';
updateProducts in the workbench will solve the error
